## Stonks Frontend Assignment

### Stonks: Twitch for Finance

At Stonks, we make finance fun! We talk about finance, but without any fuss. We are a fast-moving startup, so we need **autonomous and efficient** frontend devs who are ready to deliver good code.

## Your mission

Reproduce as much of the UI and UX from Twitch chat as possible within a maximum of 4 hours.

## Requirements

- **Technologies**: Use only React/Next and Tailwind CSS for this task.
- **Librairies**: You can use any NPM libraries you need, but you must explain your choice of each library in your submission. The fewer libraries you use, the better.

### List of messages should be in a scrollable area.

#### Tag a user

### Stop on scroll

- Implement functionality to pause the chat auto-scroll when the user is manually scrolling through the messages.

## Submission

Please submit your code by creating a public GitHub repository. Ensure that your code is well-documented and includes a README file that explains:

- How to run your project.

- Any challenges you faced during the development process and how you overcame them.
